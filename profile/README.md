## What we do

* **Logic-in-Memory architectures** – design space exploration exploiting logic-in-memory paradigm and open RTL flows  
* **Field-Coupled Nanocomputing (FCN)** – simulation, synthesis, verification
* **IoT Low‑Power Systems** – energy‑efficient IoT systems, optimization, monitoring, AI on the edge
* **Quantum control & instrumentation** – firmware, RTL design, drivers and calibration tools
* **Beyond-CMOS CAD** – new synthesis, placement and EDA algorithms

Our goal is to bridge the gap between *emerging devices*, *classical* and *quantum* world, enabling rapid, reproducible research.

## Using QNANO software

Each project is hosted as a stand-alone repository under this organisation.  
Clone a repo, follow its README and you’re good to go.  If something breaks,
please open an issue and include:

1. **Environment** (OS, compiler/interpreter, toolchain rev)  
2. **Steps to reproduce** (exact command line)  
3. **Expected / actual behaviour**
